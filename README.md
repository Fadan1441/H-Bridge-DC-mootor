This circut uses an H bridge with two push buttons that control the direction of a DC motor


The code is simple: using two if statements

if the left button is pressed, the h bridge send high voltage to the left pin in the DC motor (and low voltage to the right pin), making it move left

if the right button is pressed, the h bridge send high voltage to the right pin in the DC motor (and low voltage to the left pin), making it move right
